                            It the policy of the government for Mother and Child Health care to be provided free of charge which include
                            immunization, child growth monitoring, antenatal care and family planning. As the major causes of deaths for
                            mothers and children are associated with poor hygiene, ignorance, malnutrition, poor physical infrastructure,
                            these services contribute to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality rates in the communities.</p>
