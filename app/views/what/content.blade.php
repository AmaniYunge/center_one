                            Patient attendance figures for both outpatient and
                            inpatients wards were reasonable. This
                            group of patients has since long been the
                            major contributor of patient fees for running
                            costs. Malaria and other respiratory diseases
                            have been the major causes for patients
                            attending to this institution. It can be noted
                            also that, patients and the community at
                            large still have more confidence on health
                            services rendered by religious organization
                            than public health facilities. This is because
                            of good quality of service provided and
                            commitments of our staff.

                            Reproductive health services continued well in 2008. Prevention of preventable
                            diseases has remained one of our major goals. It the policy of the government for
                            Mother and Child Health care to be provided free of charge. Thus services that were
                            provided included immunization, child growth monitoring, antenatal care and
                            family planning. A little fee is chargeable only for deliveries. As the major causes of
                            deaths for mothers and children are associated with poor hygiene, ignorance,
                            malnutrition, poor physical infrastructure, preventive services has great
                            contribution to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality rates in the
                            catchments area.
