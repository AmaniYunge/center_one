                <h3>Donation</h3>

                <p>
                    FPCT has an open
                    policy for supports from different
                    organization and individuals when is
                    comes for social services like health.
                    As donor funding is uncertain, it has
                    been very difficult to put into the
                    annual
                    budget.
                    However,
                    the
                    institution received some funds from
                    various donors for the supporting the
                    health activities such Mr. Allan
                    Burman. The institution also got a
                    donation of a second hand generator
                    from PMU Interlife in Sweden. The
                    generator is very important not only
                    for electricity supply but also for
                    pumping water from borehole.
