                        <p> We are planning to start construction of a theatre very soon for performing emergency and planned surgeries.
                            The major purpose of this project is to bring surgery services closer to the community. At present,
                            patients are referred to Kahama District hospital which is about 27 kms away from Mpera.
                            With this distance and available poor infrastructures, becomes difficult to refer patients on time requiring
                            emergency surgery services such as pregnant mothers.  Discussions with our development partner â€“
                            Tenhult Pentecostal Church in Sweden is going on for a possibility to support the project in construction of a theatre.
                            Recently, Mr. Peter Raphael, our Administrative and Projects Manager held a discussion with the Mission Council of Tenhult
                            Church when he visited Sweden</p>

                        <p>The current building does not have enough rooms as per new guidelines laid down by Ministry of Health.
                            To meet the minimum standard, a laboratory Building should have at least rooms for Reception, Pathology,
                            Biochemistry, Sluice Room, Hematology and Blood Transfusion.</p>

                            The building was accomplished successfully under donation from Kahama Areas
                            Development Program/World Vision. The  building comprises of 4 rooms with
                            capacity of 8 beds each. In total, the ward requires 32 beds and mattresses. The
                            estimated budget for purchasing beds and  mattress is Tzs. 4,800,000 (SEK 30,000)
